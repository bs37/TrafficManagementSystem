# traffic_management

We are making an IoT based solution enabling vehicles to communicate each other and microcontrollers to coordinate traffic signals across the network helping to reduce traffic density.

This is a sub module of our application. In this module, we focuses on managing traffic at a single intersection. We can also deploy the same algorithm for city network containing multiple intersection, algorithm learns the traffic pattern/behaviours in the environment.
A framework where deep q learning reinforcement learning agent tries to coordinate various systems in the road network to maximise traffic efficiency 


##Running the Algorithm
To run the algorithm, you need to run the file training_main.py by executing the following the simple commands on Anaconda prompt or any other terminal and the agent will start the training.

**python training_main.py**

You don't need to open the SUMO software , since everything is loaded and done in the background, if you want to see training process, as it goes, you need to set to true the parameter gui contained in the file trainin_settings.ini, keep in mind that viewing the simulation is very slow in gui as compared to background training  and you need to close SUMO-gui everytime simulation ends, which is not practical

the file training_settings.ini contains all different parameters, used by the agen in simulation, default parameters are not optimized, so a bit testing will increase performance of the agent.

when the training ends the results will be stored in "./models/model_x/" where x is increasing integer starting from 1, generated automatically. Results will include some graphs, and data used to generate the graphs, the trained neural network and copy of the .ini file where the agent settings are.


##The code structure

The main file is **training_main.py**. It handles the main loop that starts an episode on every iteration. It also saves the network and 3 graphs: negative reward, cumulative wait time, and average queues. 

Overall the algorithm is divided into classes that handle different parts of the training.
- The **Model** class is used to define everything about the deep neural network and it also contains some functions used to train the network and predict the outputs. In the **model.py** file, two different **model** classes are defined: one used only during the training, one used only during the testing.
- The **Memory** class handle the memorization for the experience replay mechanism. A function is used to add a sample into the memory, while another function retrieves a batch of samples from the memory.
- The **Simulation** class handles the simulation. In particular, the function *run* allows the simulation of one episode. Also, some other functions are used during *run* to interact with SUMO, for example retrieving the state of the environment (*get_state*), set the next green light phase (*_set_green_phase*) or preprocess the data to train the neural network (*_replay*). There are two files that contain a slightly different **Simulation** class: **training_simulation.py** and **testing_simulation.py**. Which one is loaded depends of course if we are doing the training phase or the testing phase.
- The **TrafficGenerator** class contains the function dedicated to defining the route of every vehicle in one episode. The file created is *episode_routes.rou.xml* which is placed in the "intersection" folder.
- The **Visualization** class is just used for plotting data.
- In the **utils.py** file are contained some directory-related functions, such as automatically handle the creations of new model versions and the loading of existing models for the testing.

In the "intersection" folder there is a file called *environment.net.xml* which defines the structure of the environment, and it was created using SUMO NetEdit. The other file *sumo_config.sumocfg* it is a linker between the environment file and the route file. 

## The settings explained

The settings used during the training and contained in the file **training_settings.ini** are the following:
- **gui**: enable or disable the SUMO interface during the simulation.
- **total_episodes**: the number of episodes that are going to be run.
- **max_steps**: the duration of each episode, with 1 step = 1 second (default duration in SUMO).
- **n_cars_generated**: the number of cars that are generated during a single episode.
- **green_duration**: the duration in seconds of each green phase.
- **yellow_duration**: the duration in seconds of each yellow phase.
- **num_layers**: the number of hidden layers in the neural network.
- **width_layers**: the number of neurons per layer in the neural network.
- **batch_size**: the number of samples retrieved from the memory for each training iteration.
- **training_epochs**: the number of training iterations executed at the end of each episode.
- **learning_rate**: the learning rate defined for the neural network.
- **memory_size_min**: the min number of samples needed into the memory to enable the training of the neural network.
- **memory_size_max**: the max number of samples that the memory can contain.
- **num_states**: the size of the state of the env from the agent perspective (a change here requires also algorithm changes).
- **num_actions**: the number of possible actions (a change here requires also algorithm changes).
- **gamma**: the gamma parameter of the Bellman equation.
- **models_path_name**: the name of the folder that will contain the model versions and so the results. Useful to change when you want to group up some models specifying a recognizable name.
- **sumocfg_file_name**: the name of the .sumocfg file inside the *intersection* folder.

The settings used during the testing and contained in the file **testing_settings.ini** are the following (some of them have to be the same of the ones used in the relative training):
- **gui**: enable or disable the SUMO interface during the simulation.
- **max_steps**: the duration of the episode, with 1 step = 1 second (default duration in SUMO).
- **n_cars_generated**: the number of cars generated during the test episode.
- **episode_seed**: the random seed used for car generation, that should be a seed not used during training.
- **green_duration**: the duration in seconds of each green phase.
- **yellow_duration**: the duration in seconds of each yellow phase.
- **num_states**: the size of the state of the env from the agent perspective (same as training).
- **num_actions**: the number of possible actions (same as training).
- **models_path_name**: The name of the folder where to search for the specified model version to load.
- **sumocfg_file_name**: the name of the .sumocfg file inside the *intersection* folder.
- **model_to_test**: the version of the model to load for the test. 

## The Deep Q-Learning Agent

**Framework**: Q-Learning with deep neural network.

**Context**: traffic signal control of 1 intersection.

**Environment**: a 4-way intersection with 4 incoming lanes and 4 outgoing lanes per arm. Each arm is 750 meters long. Each incoming lane defines the possible directions that a car can follow: left-most lane dedicated to left-turn only; right-most lane dedicated to right-turn and straight; two middle lanes dedicated to only going straight. The layout of the traffic light system is as follows: the left-most lane has a dedicated traffic-light, while the other three lanes share the same traffic light.

**Traffic generation**: For every episode, 1000 cars are created. The car arrival timing is defined according to a Weibull distribution with shape 2 (a fast increase of arrival until peak just before the mid-episode, then slow decreasing). 75% of vehicles spawned will go straight, 25% will turn left or right. Every vehicle has the same probability to be spawned at the beginning of every arm. On every episode the cars are generated randomly so is not possible to have two equivalent episodes in term of vehicle's arrival layout.

**Agent ( Traffic Signal Control System - TLCS)**:
- **State**: discretization of oncoming lanes into presence cells, which identify the presence or absence of at least 1 vehicle inside them. There are 20 cells per arm. 10 of them are placed along the left-most lane while the other 10 are placed in the other three lanes. 80 cells in the whole intersection.
- **Action**: choice of the traffic light phase from 4 possible predetermined phases, which are described below. Every phase has a duration of 10 seconds. When the phase changes, a yellow phase of 4 seconds is activated.
  - North-South Advance: green for lanes in the north and south arm dedicated to turn right or go straight.
  - North-South Left Advance: green for lanes in the north and south arm dedicated to turn left. 
  - East-West Advance: green for lanes in the east and west arm dedicated to turn right or go straight.
  - East-West Left Advance: green for lanes in the east and west arm dedicated to turn left. 
- **Reward**: change in *cumulative waiting time* between actions, where the waiting time of a car is the number of seconds spent with speed=0 since the spawn; *cumulative* means that every waiting time of every car located in an incoming lane is summed. When a car leaves an oncoming lane (i.e. crossed the intersection), its waiting time is not considered anymore, therefore it is a positive reward for the agent.
- **Learning mechanism**: the agent make use of the Q-learning equation *Q(s,a) = reward + gamma â€¢ max Q'(s',a')* to update the action values and a deep neural network to learn the state-action function. The neural network is fully connected with 80 neurons as input (the state), 5 hidden layers of 400 neurons each, and the output layers with 4 neurons representing the 4 possible actions. Also, a mechanism of experience replay is implemented: the experience of the agent is stored in a memory and, at the end of each episode, multiple batches of randomized samples are extracted from the memory and used to train the neural network once the action values have been updated with the Q-learning equation.
